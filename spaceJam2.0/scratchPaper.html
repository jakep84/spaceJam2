mq9Matrix is a primitive,
createModel is an entity.


maybe I can build a model primitive/ entity that would
have the model built in. Should it be high order o
not? that's one to look up.

I need to add the 4th phase to hit at 35 degrees to the
agmLaunch.czml position.

<button id='MQ-9' onclick="createMq9">View MQ-9</button>
<script>
//this will be for mq9
//build viewer
var viewer = new Cesium.Viewer('cesiumContainer');
//create function to build the MQ-9
function createMq9() {
//give one postition to all models at the same time
    var position = Cesium.Cartesian3.fromDegrees(-112.729, 36.10883);
//make the heading into a radian by way of the math property.
    var heading = Cesium.Math.toRadians(270);
//adjust the pitch of the model
    var pitch = 0;
//adjust the roll (tilt) (left and right )
    var roll = 0;
// !important the orientation is a quaternion location the computation would be done
//by way of the czml headingPitchRollQuaternion "property" it takes position,
//heading, pitch, and roll into account to orient (aim) the model
    var orientation = Cesium.Transforms.headingPitchRollQuaternion(position, heading, pitch, roll);
// !important build the entity, an entity is a high order function
// as opposed to a primitive (a low order function)
    var entity = viewer.entities.add({
// take the name from the model url (below)
        name : "MQ-9",
// take the position from the position variable above
        position : position,
// get the orientation from the orientationvariable above
        orientation : orientation,
// declare height of the object
        height : 6400.0,
// build the actual model by uri and scale, you can also use the
// minimumPixelSize/ maximumPixelSize
    model : {
// add the models uri
        uri : '/spaceJam2.0/mq9.glb',
// add the scale for fast sizing
        scale : 1
    }
  })
};
</script>
